For successfully running the application, once it is cloned, please create an "APIService-Info" property list in the root application folder. 
You can use the existing APIService-Info-Sample.plist as a reference.

You should add "API_KEY" key with a valid API key as a value. 
If you don't have an API key, please refer here (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for additional information on how you can generate one.
